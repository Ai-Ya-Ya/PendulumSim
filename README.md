# PendulumSim

A pendulum physics simulator. 
Simulates the motion of various kinds of pendulums, from the simple pendulum to more complex ones, like elastic pendulums and multiple (linked) pendulums.

Written in OpenGL, with motion equations solved by [odeint](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_79_0/libs/numeric/odeint/doc/html/index.html). 

### Changelog

* **15.06.22** - added spring pendulum and implemented particle trails. 
* **29.06.22** - added double pendulum and refactored code to be object-oriented.
